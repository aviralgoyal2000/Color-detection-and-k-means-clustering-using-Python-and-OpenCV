# Color-detection-and-k-means-clustering-using-Python-and-OpenCV
In this project we are making a system that will help with the identification of various colors present in any image. For this, the system will use python programming language along with libraries like OpenCV, PIL etc. The system that we are making uses the k-means clustering method to segregate various clusters of colors and show them as output. This system can use an image in any format as input and perform various functions on it to identify the colors present in the image. The system also forms contours and help us identify the shapes of various objects present in the image. This system can be made part of various drones which can then help determine the geographical features of various landscapes. This system can run on any hardware system with a python compiler. This system is also accompanied with a user-friendly GUI to make its processing understandable and easier.
